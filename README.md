# Debiasing_Facial_Detection_System

***Debiasing Facial Recognition System*** | Self Project                          	[Jul’21] 
•	Trained standard CNN architecture on facial classification task using well-curated CelebA and ImageNet dataset

•	Build a debiased facial classifier that learns a representation of the underlying latent space to the face training data

•	Trained debiasing variational autoencoder or DB-VAE to mitigate unknown biases present within training data
